abstract = {The game of poker has been identified as a beneficial domain for current AI research because of the properties it possesses such as the need to deal with hidden information and stochasticity. The identification of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a specific focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the first serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose.}

 abstract = {We consider contests with a fixed proportion of winners based on relative performance. Special attention is paid to winnertake-all contests, which we define as contests with relatively few winners receiving relatively large awards, but we consider the full range of values of the proportion of winners. If a contestant has the opportunity to modify the distribution of her performance, what strategy is advantageous? When the proportion of winners is less than one-half, a riskier performance distribution is preferred; when this proportion is greater than one-half, it is better to choose a less risky distribution. Using a multinormal model, we consider modifications in the variability of the distribution and in correlations with the performance of other contestants. Increasing variability and decreasing correlations lead to improved chances of winning when the proportion of winners is less than one-half, and the opposite directions should be taken for proportions greater than one-half. Thus, it is better to take chances and to attempt to distance oneself from the other contestants (i.e., to break away from the herd) when there are few winners; a more conservative, herding strategy makes sense when there are many winners. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that the probability of winning can change substantially as variability and/or correlations are modified. Furthermore, in a game-theoretic setting in which all contestants can make modifications, choosing a riskier (less risky) performance distribution when the proportion of winners is low (high) is the dominant best-response strategy. We briefly consider some practical issues related to the recommended strategies and some possible extensions.},
